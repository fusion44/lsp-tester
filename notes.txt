* Working on refactoring
  + flags and logging pulled out
  ! simple server eval finds request method and params,
    nexus mode doesn't seem to
* Continue to pull fields out of messages on simple-messages branch
  - (even though they're now keyword messages)
  - e.g. textDocument
* Approaching time to go public with v1.0
